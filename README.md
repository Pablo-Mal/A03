**Tutorial on setting up git/webstorm/github**: <br>
  1. When in webstorm, select file -> New -> project<br>
  2. On top bar select VCS -> Share project on GitHub -> crate/sign into GitHub account<br>
  3. file -> New -> html -> html 5 (click accept to commiting to GitHub)<br>
  4. After creating the HTML page, on the top right of webstorm there is a checkmark that says **commit** when that is click webstorm will give you a checklist askign for everything you want to **commit**, make sure the HTML file is selected. Add a comment in the comment section describing what was changed or added (If it's teh first time put "First upload"). After, on the bottom left you will see two options **Commit** and **Commit and Push** I recommend selecting **Commit and Push** because it will save and upload/update your HTML file onto **GitHub**.<br>


**Terms**:<br>
  **Branch**- A branch is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. 

  **Clone**- is used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location.

  **Commit**-is an individual change to a file (or set of files). 

  **Fetch**- changes the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. 

  **GIT**- is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

  **Github**- is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. 

  **Merge**- Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. 

  **Merge Conflict**- A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.

  **Push**- to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.

  **Pull**- when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

  **Remote**- is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. 

  **Repository**- the most basic element of GitHub. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
